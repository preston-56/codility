# Practices

# Challenge One

Write a function that accepts two numbers a and b and returns whether a is smaller than, bigger than, or equal to b, as a string.
e.g

```txt
(5, 4)   ---> "5 is greater than 4"
(-4, -7) ---> "-4 is greater than -7"
(2, 2)   ---> "2 is equal to 2"
```
** You cannot use if statements, and you cannot use the ternary operator ? In fact, the word if and the character ? are not allowed in your code.

# Challenge Two

Count the number of occurrences of each character and return it as a (list of arrays) in order of appearance. For empty output return (an empty list).
Example:
```txt
"abracadabra" ---->  [['a', 5], ['b', 2], ['r', 2], ['c', 1], ['d', 1]]
"Code Wars -----> [['C', 1], ['o', 1], ['d', 1], ['e', 1], [' ', 1], ['W', 1], ['a', 1], ['r', 1], ['s', 1]]
"233312", ------> [['2', 2], ['3', 3], ['1', 1 ]]
```
